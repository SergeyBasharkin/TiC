It


This book is gratefully dedicated to my children. My mother and my wife taught me how to be a man. My children taught me how to be free.

“Old friend, what are you looking for?

After those many years abroad you come

With images you tended

Under foreign skies

Far away from your own land.”

But the tongue of the bee
